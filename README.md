# outlier_detection
Outlier detection in Go using the isolation forest algorithm

The package ["randomForest](https://github.com/malaschitz/randomForest) was selected for testing the ioslation forest
algorithm. The package was selected because it was listed in the curated list
[awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), had more activity than other packages with similar functionality,
and  had the most stars on Github.

It was easy enough to install the package as you would install any Go package, but I was not able to replicate the
results from the Python and R examples provided. The examples in the repository were difficult to follow and used poorly
named variables that only made things more confusing.
